# AI-IoT-Based-Rapid-Lung-Disease-Screening-System
Developed a hybrid AI-driven system capable of detecting COVID-19, COPD, Pneumonia, and other lung abnormalities in under 1 minute. The system combines CNN-based X-ray analysis (VGG16) with IoT-based spirometry data (FVC, FEV1, PEFR) to deliver accurate and affordable diagnostics for hospitals and rural health centers.
